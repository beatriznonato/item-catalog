## Curiosity
> [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) is a blockchain game on Ethereum developed by Axiom Zen that allows players to purchase,
collect, breed and sell virtual cats. It is one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain 
technology for recreation and leisure.The game's popularity in December 2017 congested the Ethereum network,
causing it to reach an all-time high in number of transactions and slowing it down significantly.
